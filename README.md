This is a user-friendly Matlab program that simplifies the design of Model Predictive Control (MPC) systems. Our motivation behind creating this tool is to address the lack of user-friendly software that integrates both MPC and the Kalman filter techniques. While the Matlab MPC Toolbox is widely used, it still requires users to define control loops and specify state update rules, which can be complex for those lacking expertise. Our software streamlines the design process by offering an intuitive interface and seamlessly integrating the Kalman filter with MPC. We aim to support industry adoption of MPC by providing an accessible solution that bridges the gap between theory and practice. The software allows users to interact with the MPC system, visualize results, and optionally combine a Kalman filter. This software has been submitted to the Software Impacts journal. Upon publication, additional documents will be added to this repository, providing detailed instructions, examples, and analytical solutions to verify the correctness of the software.
